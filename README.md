YiiAdvancedSetup
================

This is a standard Yii webapp there are only added some core features.

Added modules:
- Rights: This extension utilizes Yii's built-in Database Authorization Manager (CDbAuthManager) to provide a web interface for advanced access control.
- Translate: This extension collects all untranslated messages in the page and then you can add a button to translate, translate automatically using google translate, check for missing translations, edit translations and more.
- Ei18n: Ei18n is a translation module to allow Yii'ers to easily manage missing translations on application pages. It is heavily inspired by yii.translate developed by Gustavo Salom√© Silva gusnips.(replaces translate module)

Added extensions:
- EMenu: This extension class extends CMenu
- EfontAwesome
- sass (scssphp)
- backjob
- yiimailer

The following extensions are planned to add:
- Highcharts
